a) Problem Statement Reference:

Problem Statement Chosen
"Create a digital marketplace for buying and selling vehicles, including features for search, filtering, listings, user authentication, and seller interaction."

Reason to Choose the Problem Statement:
The vehicle resale market in India is rapidly digitizing. However, many existing platforms lack proper filtering, secure communication between buyers and sellers, and advanced features like price prediction or recommendation engines. This project aims to bridge those gaps with a streamlined, user-centric solution.

b) Solution Overview :

Proposed Approach:
Build a responsive web application that allows users to list, browse, and filter vehicles for sale. Include secure authentication, advanced search, and potential ML-based enhancements like price suggestion.

Key Features / Modules:
User Authentication (Login / Signup)
Vehicle Listing & Browsing
Search with Filters (Brand, Price, Type, Fuel, etc.)
Detailed Vehicle Pages
Contact Seller / Chat Module
Admin Dashboard
EMI Calculator

c) System Architecture : 

   Start
  │
  ▼
Home Page
  │
  ├── Browse Vehicles → View Specs → EMI & Fuel Cost → Book Vehicle
  │
  ├── Find Showroom → Book Test Ride
  │
  ├── Sell Old Bike → AI Price & Condition → Post Listing
  │
  └── User Account (Login / Saved / History)
  │
  ▼
End (Booking / Listing / Test Ride Done)

d) Technology Stack :

Frontend:
React.js
HTML & Tailwind CSS

Backend:
Node.js
Express.js

Databases:
MongoDB 

Machine Learning Frameworks (Optional) :
Python
Scikit-learn
Flask (for ML API)

APIs / Libraries :
JWT (Authentication)
Bcrypt (Password Hashing)
Multer (Image Uploads)
Axios (HTTP Requests)
React Router DOM
Mongoose

e) Algorithms & Models (If ML is implemented) :

Algorithms Chosen :
Linear Regression / XGBoost for price prediction

Reason for Choice:
Linear Regression is simple and explainable. XGBoost provides better accuracy for numerical prediction. Recommendation models enhance user experience by suggesting similar vehicles.

Model Training & Testing Approach :
Data preprocessing: handle nulls, encode categorical variables, normalize features
Train-test split and model training using scikit-learn
Evaluate using R² Score and RMSE
Save trained model using Pickle
Deploy as a Flask API for backend integration

f) Data Handling :

Data Sources Used :
Publicly available datasets 
Manually entered listings via the application

Preprocessing Methods :
Cleaning null values
Label encoding or one-hot encoding
Feature scaling 

Storage / Pipeline Setup :
MongoDB used for storing listings, user data, messages, and uploads
Multer used for handling image uploads
Cloud or local storage

g) Implementation Plan :

Initial Setup & Environment :
Initialize Git repository
Set up Node.js, React.js environments
Connect to MongoDB Atlas
Define project structure and install dependencies

Core Module Development :
User authentication module
Vehicle listing creation and browsing
Search and filter module
Admin panel
ML & Micro Services

Integration & Testing :
Connect frontend and backend via REST APIs
Use Postman for backend API testing
Manual testing on UI and forms

Final Deployment-ready Build :
Optimize frontend build using Webpack
Deploy frontend on Netlify or Vercel
Deploy backend on Render, Railway, or similar
Connect with MongoDB Atlas
Optional : Deploy ML microservice on Render or using Docker

h) Performance & Validation :

Evaluation Metrics :
API response time
Page load speed
Database query latency

Testing Strategy :
Unit testing for backend logic 
Manual UI testing
API testing using Postman
Optional: Selenium for automated end-to-end tests

i) Deployment & Scalability : (USING SYSTEM DESING AND COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE CONCEPTS)

Deployment Plan:
Frontend deployed on Netlify or Vercel
Backend hosted on Render, Railway, or Heroku
MongoDB Atlas used for cloud database
Flask ML API hosted separately (Render or Docker container)

Scalability Considerations :
Pagination in vehicle listing endpoints
Rate limiting and caching for popular queries
Lazy loading for images
Containerized deployment (Docker) for scaling
Potential migration to microservices for high traffic scenarios
